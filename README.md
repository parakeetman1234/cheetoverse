# Cheetoverse
A Go clone of [Kemoverse v1.1](https://git.waifuism.life/waifu/kemoverse/projects/2) for Pleroma and Mastodon.

# Project goals
- Be as close to the original project as possible; it should be a finger snap to switch from Cheetoverse to Kemoverse v1.1.
- Use a low number of computing resources. It should be possible to run this on a Raspberry Pi sitting in the corner of your room.
